Dmitry Babichev, Dmitrii Ostrovskii, Francis Bach, Efficient primal-dual algorithms for large-scale multiclass classification

## Running the experiments
The experiments, in the order of appearance in the paper, are launched via the following MATLAB commands: 

Table 01 can be obtained, evaluating file Table01.m

Figures 1 and 2 can be obtained as following:

1 step: Evaluate files Experiment01_01_FULL.m, Experiment01_02_SGD.m and Experiment01_03_DET.m
The data will be stored in files. 
2 step: Evaluate the files Plot01.m and Plot02.m to get the plots.
